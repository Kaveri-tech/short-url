*How This Works in the App Flow
User logs in:

    1.They submit login form → POST /user/login

    2.Controller verifies credentials → If valid:

        Creates a unique session ID (UUID)  

        Calls setUser(sessionId, user) to store session

        Sends cookie "uid" with that session ID to the client

    3.User’s browser stores cookie "uid".

*User requests protected routes:

    1.Browser sends request with cookie "uid".

    2.Middleware restrictToLoggedinUserOnly runs:

        Extracts session ID from cookie

        Calls getUser(sessionId)

        If found, attaches user info to req.user

        Otherwise redirects to /login

    3.Protected route handler can access logged-in user via req.user.

*User requests public routes (like homepage or login page):

    1.Middleware checkAuth runs:

        Tries to get user from session cookie (if any)

        Attaches user info or null to req.user

    2.Route handlers can check if user is logged in and render accordingly.
